### Possible Flag Aspect Ratios Encountered (adhering to official specifications listed by each nation for their flag)

```ts
// width/height (more useful for css) -> hoist:fly (traditional aspect ratio formatting for flags being a special use-case, where the height of the flag precedes the width in the aspect ratio as counterintuitive as this is)
// eg, the US flag has an aspect ratio of 19:10 (19x10 for dimensions of wxh) but many government entities list it as 10:19 following the counterintuitive hoist:fly aspect ratio for flags...
"3/2" | "7/5" | "19/10" | "10/7" | "8/5" | "2/1" | "5/3" | "15/13" | "22/15" | "11/8" | "11/6" | "4/3" | "37/28" | "335/189" | "11/7" | "18/11" | "41/22" | "1/1" | "25/18" | "7/4" | "5/4" | "1.21901033/1" | "36/19" | "7/6" | "20/11" | "28/11" | "1.618/1"
