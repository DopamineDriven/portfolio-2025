### TODO

Accessibility: Ensure that the navigation controls are keyboard accessible and properly labeled for screen readers. You can add `aria-label` attributes to the navigation buttons to describe their function.
Analysis mode: You could implement an analysis mode where players can freely navigate through the game history and explore alternative moves without affecting the actual game state.
Export game: Add a feature to export the game in PGN (Portable Game Notation) format, allowing players to save and share their games.
