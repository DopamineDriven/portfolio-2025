### Portfolio 2025

Thanks for the extra detail — I’ll look into how best to integrate `eslint-import-resolver-typescript` into your ESM-only monorepo setup using `@/*` path aliases, and analyze whether swapping to `eslint-plugin-import-x` will improve linting accuracy or performance. I’ll also provide refinements to optimize ESLint speed and dev experience for large TypeScript monorepos using flat config.

I’ll get back to you shortly with concrete recommendations and updated file contents.

# Optimizing ESLint for a TypeScript Monorepo (Path Aliases, Plugins, and Performance)

## 1. Integrating the TypeScript Import Resolver (`eslint-import-resolver-typescript`)

To ensure ESLint correctly resolves your TypeScript path aliases (like `@/...`) and `.ts` file imports, you should add **`eslint-import-resolver-typescript`** to your shared config. This resolver allows ESLint’s import rules to understand TypeScript files and path mappings defined in your `tsconfig.json` ([eslint-import-resolver-typescript - npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-import-resolver-typescript#:~:text=,package.json)). In practice, this means ESLint will no longer complain about imports like `import { X } from "@/foo.ts"` – it will recognize the `@` alias and the `.ts` extension as valid ([eslint-import-resolver-typescript - npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-import-resolver-typescript#:~:text=,package.json)).

**Steps to integrate:**

- **Install the resolver** in your ESLint config package (and in any repo that runs ESLint, if the config is not bundling it). For example, with npm or pnpm:  

  ```bash
  pnpm i -D eslint-import-resolver-typescript
  ```  

  Ensure `eslint-plugin-import` is also up to date. (If you were setting up from scratch, the plugin and resolver are typically installed together ([eslint-import-resolver-typescript - npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-import-resolver-typescript#:~:text=%60eslint)).)

- **Update your flat ESLint config** to use the resolver. In ESLint’s flat config, you add a `settings` field with the resolver configuration. For example, in your `eslint.config.js` (or `.mjs`):

  ```js
  import tsPlugin from "typescript-eslint";
  import importPlugin from "eslint-plugin-import";
  // ^ import the plugins (assuming ESM). Ensure these are in your package deps.

  export default [
    {
      files: ["**/*.ts", "**/*.tsx"],  // lint TypeScript files
      ignores: [
        "**/node_modules/**",
        "**/dist/**",
        "**/build/**"               // ignore generated files to speed up linting
      ],
      languageOptions: {
        parser: tsPlugin.parser,    // @typescript-eslint parser
        parserOptions: {
          ecmaVersion: "latest",
          sourceType: "module",
          // Point to all tsconfig files in the repo (monorepo support):
          project: [
            "./tsconfig.json",              // root tsconfig (if it exists)
            "./packages/*/tsconfig.json",   // tsconfigs in packages
            "./apps/*/tsconfig.json"        // tsconfigs in apps (if you have an `apps/` dir)
          ],
          tsconfigRootDir: process.cwd()    // root of the project (monorepo root)
        }
      },
      plugins: {
        // Flat config: include plugin objects
        "@typescript-eslint": tsPlugin,
        "import": importPlugin,
        // ...other plugins...
      },
      /** 👉 Integrate TypeScript resolver for eslint-plugin-import: */
      settings: {
        "import/resolver": {
          // Use TypeScript resolver so import plugin knows about .ts and paths:
          typescript: {
            alwaysTryTypes: true,  // always prefer @types packages if they exist
            project: [
              "./packages/*/tsconfig.json",
              "./apps/*/tsconfig.json"
            ]
            // (You can add `bun: true` here if you use Bun, but it's optional)
          }
        }
      },
      rules: {
        // Example: allow .ts extensions in imports (no error for using .ts in path)
        "import/extensions": ["error", "ignorePackages", {
          ts: "always",
          tsx: "always",
          js: "never",
          jsx: "never"
        }],
        // ...your other rules (typescript-eslint rules, import rules, etc.)...
      }
    }
  ];
  ```  

  In the **`settings.import/resolver.typescript`** section above, we configure the resolver: 
  - `project` is set to an array of tsconfig paths. This should include all the tsconfig files for your packages/apps. Glob patterns are supported (note the use of `packages/*/tsconfig.json`). It’s important to avoid overly broad globs like `**/tsconfig.json` because those can degrade performance – a single `*` per folder level is preferabl ([Monorepo Configuration | typescript-eslint](https://typescript-eslint.io/troubleshooting/typed-linting/monorepos#:~:text=Wide%20globs%20in%20))】. The example uses separate patterns for `packages` and `apps` directories; adjust these to match your repository structure. This ensures the resolver knows about each package’s path aliases and types.
  - `alwaysTryTypes: true` tells the resolver to also check `@types` packages if needed (helpful for packages that have their types in DefinitelyTyped).
  - We did **not** set `extensions` here because the TypeScript resolver by default knows about `.ts/.tsx` file ([eslint-import-resolver-typescript - npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-import-resolver-typescript#:~:text=,package.json))】. With this config, imports of `.ts` files or files using your `paths` aliases will be recognized and the `import/no-unresolved` rule (from eslint-plugin-import) will stop flagging those as errors.

- **Verify `.ts` extension handling:** By default, the import plugin might expect certain extensions. In ESM, including the file extension in imports is often required. In the example config, we added an `import/extensions` rule configuration to allow `.ts` in imports. This rule is optional, but if you had it enabled, you likely want to configure it to **allow or require `.ts`** for TypeScript files to match your project style. For instance, the sample above sets `"ts": "always"` meaning it should always include the `.ts` extension for TypeScript imports. Adjust this to your preference (or disable the rule if you don’t need it). The key is that ESLint should not complain about the presence or absence of `.ts` in your import statements once configured.

After these changes, ESLint will use the TypeScript resolver. This means when you do `import { X } from "@/foo.ts"`, the resolver will read your tsconfig paths to find what `@/foo.ts` refers to, and it will treat `.ts` files as first-class modules for import rule ([eslint-import-resolver-typescript - npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-import-resolver-typescript#:~:text=,package.json))】. In summary, **any path aliases defined in tsconfig and any `.ts/.tsx` modules will be properly resolved** by ESLint, eliminating false “unable to resolve path” error ([eslint-import-resolver-typescript - npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-import-resolver-typescript#:~:text=,package.json))】.

> **Note:** Make sure all your source files that need linting are included in one of the tsconfig files listed under `project`. If a file isn’t included in a tsconfig, the TypeScript ESLint parser might try to create an implicit project for it, which is slow. It’s often helpful to create a special `tsconfig.eslint.json` that **includes all** TypeScript files across your monorepo (or ensure each package’s tsconfig includes its test files, etc. ([Monorepo Configuration | typescript-eslint](https://typescript-eslint.io/troubleshooting/typed-linting/monorepos#:~:text=If%20you%20only%20have%20one,eslint%20without%20further%20configuration)) ([Monorepo Configuration | typescript-eslint](https://typescript-eslint.io/troubleshooting/typed-linting/monorepos#:~:text=project%3A%20true%2C%20project%3A%20%5B%27.%2Ftsconfig.eslint.json%27%2C%20%27.%2Fpackages%2F,))】. Pointing the resolver (and parser) at that ensures no file is missed. This can improve accuracy and performance for type-aware rules.

## 2. Switching to `eslint-plugin-import-x`: Pros, Cons, and Compatibility

**`eslint-plugin-import-x`** is a fork of the standard eslint-plugin-import, designed to be faster and more lightweigh ([eslint-plugin-import-x/CHANGELOG.md at master · un-ts/eslint-plugin-import-x · GitHub](https://github.com/un-ts/eslint-plugin-import-x/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#:~:text=%2A%20,version%20of%20the%20original%20plugin))】. It is mostly a drop-in replacement, but there are some differences. Here’s an evaluation of switching to **import-x** in your context:

**✅ Pros (Benefits of eslint-plugin-import-x):**

- **Improved Performance:** The primary goal of import-x is to significantly speed up linting of imports in large codebase ([eslint-plugin-import-x/CHANGELOG.md at master · un-ts/eslint-plugin-import-x · GitHub](https://github.com/un-ts/eslint-plugin-import-x/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#:~:text=%2A%20,version%20of%20the%20original%20plugin))】. The maintainers have made various performance optimizations (e.g. refactoring the internal module export map and speeding up cyclical dependency checks) to make rules run faste ([eslint-plugin-import-x/CHANGELOG.md at master · un-ts/eslint-plugin-import-x · GitHub](https://github.com/un-ts/eslint-plugin-import-x/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#:~:text=%2A%20,util))】. Many rules in import-x are optimized compared to the original. For example, the `no-cycle` rule and others that traverse module graphs have been refactored for efficienc ([eslint-plugin-import-x/CHANGELOG.md at master · un-ts/eslint-plugin-import-x · GitHub](https://github.com/un-ts/eslint-plugin-import-x/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#:~:text=%2A%20,util))】. In a big monorepo, these improvements can reduce ESLint runtime, especially on rules that previously took a lot of time.

- **Better ESM and modern support:** Import-x has kept up with modern module resolution features. It supports the same core functionality as eslint-plugin-import (static analysis of ES6 imports/exports), but with up-to-date enhancements. For instance, it fully supports parsing newer syntax and offers better integration with the ESLint flat config and ESM environment. One convenience with import-x (v4.5.0 and above) is that in a flat config you can programmatically create the resolver settings. This means you can `import { createTypeScriptImportResolver } from 'eslint-import-resolver-typescript'` and use it directly in your config (via the new `import-x/resolver-next` setting ([eslint-import-resolver-typescript - npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-import-resolver-typescript#:~:text=%2F%2F%20eslint,typescript))】. In other words, **import-x can directly accept the resolver as an import** (no magic string in settings), which is nicer in pure ESM configs. The original plugin (import-js) doesn’t support that yet, and requires the settings to be a plain JSON objec ([eslint-import-resolver-typescript - npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-import-resolver-typescript#:~:text=But%20if%20you%20are%20using,x%60%2C%20you%20can%27t%20use%20require%2Fimport))】. This improved integration can simplify your config if you switch.

- **Active Development:** The fork is actively maintained by the community (with involvement from TypeScript ESLint team members, as noted in the typescript-eslint v8 announcement) and tends to respond faster to TypeScript-centric issues. It has collaboration with the TypeScript-ESLint team for compatibility with new ESLint v9/flat config features, etc. (import-x was an early adopter of flat config support). This means going forward, import-x is likely to stay in sync with ESLint and TypeScript advancements. For example, import-x provides configuration points for caching and resolver customization that can be tweaked for performance or environment (Node, Bun, etc.), giving you more flexibility than the older plugin.

- **Similar Rule Set:** Import-x implements essentially the same rules as eslint-plugin-import, so you wouldn’t be losing functionality. All the familiar rules (`import/no-unresolved`, `import/named`, `import/order`, etc.) exist in import-x (often under the same name or with minor naming differences). The default rule configurations (like “recommended”) are equivalent, so behavior should be nearly identical. In some cases, import-x has fixed edge-case bugs from the original, so you might actually see *fewer* false positives/negatives in certain import edge cases.

**⚠️ Cons (Potential drawbacks or considerations):**

- **Migration Effort and Naming Changes:** Swapping the plugin requires some updates to your config files. The plugin name will change from `"import"` to `"import-x"` in your flat config. For example, you’ll import it as:  
  ```js
  import importX from "eslint-plugin-import-x";
  ```  
  and include it in `plugins` as `"import-x": importX`. All the rule identifiers would then use the `import-x/` prefix instead of `import/`. (If you keep the prefix `import/` in your rule names, ESLint will try to find those rules in a plugin named "import", which would be missing, leading to “rule not found” errors. So you’ll want to update rules to the new prefix or use the plugin’s recommended config.) This is mostly a search-and-replace task, but it’s something to be aware of. For example, `"import/no-unresolved": "error"` becomes `"import-x/no-unresolved": "error"`, and so on.

- **Compatibility with Existing Config:** Aside from rule name changes, most of your configuration can remain the same. The settings section for the resolver needs to use import-x’s key. Import-x supports two forms of resolver config:
  - **Legacy mode:** Using `"import-x/resolver"` (which works similar to the original `"import/resolver"` setting).
  - **New mode:** Using `"import-x/resolver-next"` with the `createTypeScriptImportResolver` function (this is available since import-x v4.5). Since you are using a flat config and ESM, you can take advantage of `resolver-next`. For example:  
    ```js
    import importX from "eslint-plugin-import-x";
    import { createTypeScriptImportResolver } from "eslint-import-resolver-typescript";

    export default [
      {
        // ... languageOptions, etc ...
        plugins: {
          "import-x": importX,
          // other plugins...
        },
        settings: {
          "import-x/resolver-next": [
            createTypeScriptImportResolver({
              alwaysTryTypes: true,
              project: ["./packages/*/tsconfig.json", "./apps/*/tsconfig.json"]
            })
          ]
        },
        rules: {
          "import-x/no-unresolved": "error",
          "import-x/named": "error",
          // ... (you can keep your rule settings the same, just with the new prefix)
        }
      }
    ];
    ```  
    This shows how your config would change if switching. The rest of your TypeScript-ESLint setup stays unchanged. Note that import-x uses its own namespace for settings and rules. This **one-time refactor** of the config is a minor overhead.

- **Stability and Community Adoption:** While import-x is gaining popularity (and even the official resolver docs mention it as an option for spee ([eslint-import-resolver-typescript - npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-import-resolver-typescript#:~:text=This%20is%20a%20resolver%20for,x%20for%20faster%20speed))】), it’s still a fork. The original eslint-plugin-import is very mature and widely used; import-x is newer. In practice, many projects (especially those using flat config or seeking performance gains) have switched to import-x without issues, but you may want to test it in your monorepo to ensure there are no unexpected lint rule differences. The core logic is the same, but subtle behaviors could differ. For example, import-x might have changed default settings for some rules or disabled very slow rules by default. Be prepared to compare a lint run before/after switch to confirm nothing critical is flagged or missed.

- **Ongoing Updates:** Because import-x is actively evolving, you might see more frequent releases (which can be a pro for fixes, but also means you should keep an eye on changelogs). For instance, future major versions plan to rename some rules (like splitting `no-cycle` into new versions) and deprecate legacy settings as ESLint’s old config format is phased ou ([eslint-plugin-import-x/CHANGELOG.md at master · un-ts/eslint-plugin-import-x · GitHub](https://github.com/un-ts/eslint-plugin-import-x/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#:~:text=In%20the%20next%20major%20version,legacy)) ([eslint-plugin-import-x/CHANGELOG.md at master · un-ts/eslint-plugin-import-x · GitHub](https://github.com/un-ts/eslint-plugin-import-x/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#:~:text=A%20new%20%60no,in%20the%20next%20major%20version))】. This isn’t a deal-breaker, but it means you’ll need to occasionally update your config as you upgrade the plugin. With the original plugin, changes are slower and more incremental.

**Performance Comparison:** In many cases, teams have reported a noticeable drop in ESLint runtime after moving to import-x, especially in large projects. The import-x changelog notes general speed improvements (e.g., making the overall import processing faster by refactoring how module exports are tracke ([eslint-plugin-import-x/CHANGELOG.md at master · un-ts/eslint-plugin-import-x · GitHub](https://github.com/un-ts/eslint-plugin-import-x/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#:~:text=%2A%20,util))】). That said, the actual gain depends on which rules you use. Some of the most expensive rules in eslint-plugin-import (like `import/no-cycle`, `import/namespace`, `import/no-unused-modules`) are still heavy in import-x, though often somewhat optimized. If your current bottleneck is import resolution and module traversal, import-x should help. If you’re only using a few simple rules from eslint-plugin-import, the difference might be marginal. Given that you’re already experiencing slow linting, it’s likely import-x will provide some relief.

**ESM Support:** Both plugins support ESM, but import-x is itself published as an ESM-compatible package and is built with modern ESM usage in mind. It handles Node’s `"exports"` field resolution better (especially when paired with the TypeScript resolver) and has experimental support for alternative resolvers like a new Rust-based resolver (`eslint-import-resolver-oxc`). In contrast, the original plugin relies on Node’s resolution or the installed resolver and had known issues with package exports that the TypeScript resolver had to solv ([add `eslint-import-resolver-typescript` as a dependency · Issue #150 · un-ts/eslint-plugin-import-x · GitHub](https://github.com/un-ts/eslint-plugin-import-x/issues/150#:~:text=%3E%20I%20think%20eslint,resolved%20in%20the%20typescript%20resolver))】. By using import-x + the TS resolver, you’re effectively on the most up-to-date path for ESLint module resolution.

**🟢 Recommendation:** If performance is a top concern and you’re willing to do a bit of config tweaking, switching to **eslint-plugin-import-x** is worth considering. It should be mostly compatible with your existing rules and will integrate well with your ESM flat config setup. Just plan the migration: update the dependency, change plugin name in config, change rule prefixes, and adjust the settings as shown above. Keep the TypeScript resolver in place (as demonstrated) – the import-x plugin will use it in the same way (or even more seamlessly if using the `resolver-next` API as in the snippet). Make sure to run your lint suite after switching to catch any differences. Overall, you can expect equal or better accuracy (no lost functionality) and improved speed with import-x. The original plugin remains perfectly fine if you prefer stability, but many large ESM+TypeScript projects have gravitated to import-x for its performance wi ([eslint-plugin-import-x/CHANGELOG.md at master · un-ts/eslint-plugin-import-x · GitHub](https://github.com/un-ts/eslint-plugin-import-x/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#:~:text=%2A%20,version%20of%20the%20original%20plugin))4】.

## 3. Improving ESLint Performance in a Large Monorepo

Beyond plugin choices, there are several strategies to speed up ESLint in a growing monorepo and improve the developer experience. You’re already on ESLint 9 (flat config) and using modern tools, which is great. Here are some recommendations to refine your config and workflow for better performance:

- **Limit Linting to Necessary Files:** Configure ESLint to ignore or exclude files that don’t need linting. This reduces the work ESLint does. In the flat config, we can use the `files` and `ignores` fields (as shown in the config snippet above). You should ensure `node_modules` and build output directories (`dist`, `build`, etc.) are ignored. For example, in the config we added:  
  ```js
  ignores: ["**/node_modules/**", "**/dist/**", "**/build/**"]
  ```  
  This prevents ESLint from traversing those folders at all. Additionally, set `files: ["**/*.ts", "**/*.tsx"]` (and any other extensions you care about) so that ESLint only evaluates TypeScript files (if you have no plain JS files to lint). By being specific, you avoid ESLint trying to parse other file types. **Tip:** Also ignore large generated files (if any) or test fixture files, etc., that you don’t need to lint.

- **Optimize TypeScript Project Setup for ESLint:** As mentioned, include all linted files in your tsconfig(s). Missing file inclusions can trigger the TypeScript parser to fallback to a slower one-file-at-a-time mode. Consider creating a **central tsconfig for linting** that extends your base config and includes every `.ts(x)` file in the monorepo (sources, tests, etc ([Monorepo Configuration | typescript-eslint](https://typescript-eslint.io/troubleshooting/typed-linting/monorepos#:~:text=If%20you%20only%20have%20one,eslint%20without%20further%20configuration))7】. Reference this in `parserOptions.project`. This way, TypeScript can create a single Program for your entire workspace (or one per package) and reuse it, rather than spinning up a new type-checking instance for files it doesn’t know about. Also, set compilerOptions like `"skipLibCheck": true` in your tsconfig – this avoids type-checking library `.d.ts` files, which ESLint doesn’t need to repeatedly validate. Ensuring `"noEmit": true` in the tsconfig used by ESLint is wise as well, to avoid any compile output attemp ([Monorepo Configuration | typescript-eslint](https://typescript-eslint.io/troubleshooting/typed-linting/monorepos#:~:text=,paths%20you%20intend%20to%20lint))6】. If your monorepo is very large, you might use multiple tsconfigs (one per package) as we’ve done. The TypeScript ESLint parser will pick the appropriate tsconfig for each file based on the glob patterns. Just remember: **avoid using a wildcard like `**` in those globs**, because it makes ESLint scan a lot of directories and can slow down config matching. Use patterns like `packages/*/tsconfig.json` instead of `**/tsconfig.jso ([Monorepo Configuration | typescript-eslint](https://typescript-eslint.io/troubleshooting/typed-linting/monorepos#:~:text=Wide%20globs%20in%20))7】.

- **Adjust or Disable Very Expensive Rules:** Some ESLint rules are known to be performance hogs. It’s important to identify these in your config and consider if they’re worth the cost. In the context of module linting:
  - **`import/no-cycle`:** Detecting circular dependencies can be expensive in a large project because it may traverse many files. If your project isn’t at risk of a lot of circular deps (or you can rely on runtime/TypeScript to catch issues), you might disable this rule or use the newer `import/no-cycle` from import-x which has some improvements. If you keep it, consider setting a max depth if the rule supports it.
  - **`import/namespace`:** This rule checks namespace imports (`import * as X from 'module'`) for correctness. It’s reported to be particularly sl ([`import/namespace` is very slow · Issue #2340 · import-js/eslint-plugin-import · GitHub](https://github.com/import-js/eslint-plugin-import/issues/2340#:~:text=,import%232340))9】 because it ends up parsing every imported file to verify named exports. Projects have found that disabling `import/namespace` yields a big performance gain with minimal downsi ([`import/namespace` is very slow · Issue #2340 · import-js/eslint-plugin-import · GitHub](https://github.com/import-js/eslint-plugin-import/issues/2340#:~:text=,import%232340))9】 (especially if you’re already using TypeScript, which will error on invalid imports anyway). You might safely turn this one off.
  - **`import/no-unused-modules`:** If you ever enabled this, note that it scans the entire project for unused exports — very slow on a monorepo. Many choose not to use this rule in large projects.
  - **Type-aware rules:** Any rules from `@typescript-eslint` that require type information (those in the “recommended-type-checked” set) will add to lint time because they query the TypeScript type checker. While these are extremely useful, you might scope them to certain folders (for example, maybe you don’t need heavy type linting on test files or demo code). You could have separate config blocks for different glob patterns – e.g., enable the type-aware rules only in `src/**` but not in `tests/**` if that makes sense for you. This can cut down work without losing important checks where they matter.
  
  In summary, do an audit of your rules and weigh the benefit vs cost. Disabling a few of the worst offenders can easily knock seconds off the lint time. (ESLint’s own timing output can help identify which rules take longest.)

- **Use ESLint Caching for CLI runs:** When running ESLint in CI or via command line, always use the `--cache` flag (and optionally `--cache-location` to specify the cache file). ESLint’s cache will save the lint results for files and only re-lint files that have changed since the last run. This can **massively speed up repeated lint runs** (often only a fraction of files change between commits). For example, add to your package.json lint script:  
  ```json
  "lint": "eslint . --cache"
  ```  
  This way, developers running lint locally or your CI pipeline will skip unchanged files. (The first run creates the cache, subsequent runs are incremental.) This doesn’t directly affect the VS Code editor experience, but it helps with pre-commit hooks or full repo lint checks.

- **Leverage VS Code ESLint Settings for Monorepo:** In VS Code, the ESLint extension can be tuned for a workspace with multiple projects:
  - **Enable Flat Config:** Ensure you set `"eslint.experimental.useFlatConfig": true` in your VS Code settings (workspace settings). This is needed for ESLint v9 flat configs to be recognized by the extension (since flat config is relatively new). Without this, the extension might be falling back to no config or a wrong config.
  - **Multiple Working Directories:** Use the `"eslint.workingDirectories"` setting to optimize how the ESLint server runs in a monorepo. This setting allows ESLint to run separately in each project folder, rather than treating the whole monorepo as one giant project. By splitting the lint process per package, it can reduce memory usage and also scope type information to the right tsconfig. You can configure it with glob patterns. For example, in your **workspace `.vscode/settings.json`**:  
    ```json
    {
      "eslint.workingDirectories": [
        { "pattern": "packages/*" },
        { "pattern": "apps/*" }
      ]
    }
    ```  
    This tells the ESLint extension to treat each folder under `packages/` and `apps/` as a separate ESLint project with its own working directory. So if you open a file in `packages/foo/src/index.ts`, ESLint will run with `packages/foo` as the cwd and will pick up that package’s tsconfig context first. This can prevent cross-talk between projects and means ESLint doesn’t load all tsconfigs at once unnecessari ([

    ](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint#:~:text=the%20,directory%20setup%20looks%20as%20follows))2】. It’s effectively similar to running ESLint on each package individually, which is often faster than one big run on the whole repo.
  - **Auto-fix Only on Save (optional):** If you find that ESLint is re-linting as you type (which can be slow if each lint takes several seconds), you can adjust the mode. In the VS Code ESLint settings, you might set `"eslint.run": "onSave"` instead of the default `"onType"`. With `"onSave"`, ESLint will only validate when you save the file, not continuously while editing. This can significantly improve editor responsiveness for large projects (at the cost of not catching issues until you hit save). Many developers prefer on-save linting in large codebases to avoid interruptions.
  - **Editor Integration Tip:** Make sure the VS Code ESLint extension is using the workspace’s ESLint version (it usually does). Also, update it to the latest version – performance improvements are often made in the extension as well. As of ESLint extension 3.x, it runs ESLint as a language server and can reuse a single process. The extension’s release notes indicate that using `eslint.workingDirectories` with auto-changing of CWD is supported (and now even supports glob pattern ([

    ](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint#:~:text=,cwd))4】, which we used above.

- **Parallelize where possible:** Outside of VS Code, if you run lint tasks in CI or scripts, take advantage of parallelism. You can lint sub-projects in parallel (since ESLint is single-threaded per process). For example, run `eslint` on each package concurrently (there are npm packages and build tools that help with this in monorepos). This doesn’t change the per-file cost but can utilize multiple cores to handle a large monorepo faster. Also consider using **ESLint’s built-in caching** (as mentioned) in CI, or even repository-wide caching (some CI systems or monorepo tools like Nx can cache successful lint results between runs).

- **Monitor and profile ESLint**: When your repo grows, periodically run ESLint with the `TIMING=1` environment variable (for ESLint 9) or `--timing` flag if available. This will output performance timings per rule. It can help you catch if a particular rule suddenly becomes a bottleneck. For instance, you might discover down the line that a rule from another plugin (perhaps a security or complexity rule) is taking 3 seconds alone – then you can decide to adjust it. Since you’re already observing “Validation took 6568ms”, using such diagnostics can pinpoint what contributed to those 6.5 seconds.

By applying these strategies, you should see a noticeable improvement in ESLint’s speed and responsiveness. In a nutshell: **reduce the scope** of what ESLint has to check (files and rules), **enable caching** so repeated work is minimized, and **configure your tools** (ESLint and editor) to work efficiently with a multi-project setup. This will make the developer experience much smoother as your monorepo continues to grow.

Great, I’ll look into creating a seamless, fluid scaling solution for your React Three Fiber elevator scene. The goal is to ensure the elevator and its button are always visible and interactable across all screen sizes, particularly mobile portrait view, by dynamically adjusting the canvas size and camera framing—without impacting the layout of the 3D objects themselves.

I’ll explore strategies using Tailwind and/or global CSS to achieve this, along with best practices for canvas container responsiveness. I’ll also identify any relevant camera control or viewport utility tweaks within R3F to help ensure pixel-perfect alignment.

I’ll report back shortly with a tailored solution.

# Responsive 3D Elevator Scene Layout (Next.js + R3F + TailwindCSS)

## 1. Overview 
This guide outlines a **responsive layout strategy** for a Three.js scene (using **@react-three/fiber**) in a Next.js app. We focus on a cinematic “elevator intro” sequence (inspired by *Severance*) with interactive elements (elevator doors and a call button). The goal is to **preserve the elevator-centric composition** while making the scene fluidly adapt to various screen sizes. On narrow viewports (like mobile portrait), peripheral scene elements can be cropped off-screen, but the **elevator and its call button remain fully visible and clickable**. We’ll leverage TailwindCSS (and minimal global CSS) for layout, avoid @react-three/flex (due to React 19 issues), and implement a lightweight, scene-specific solution. Key considerations include dynamic canvas sizing, camera framing adjustments (FOV/aspect/position), and mobile usability best practices.

## 2. Full-Screen Canvas Container with TailwindCSS 
Start by setting up a responsive container that ensures the **R3F `<Canvas>` fills the viewport** and centers the action. Tailwind utility classes make this straightforward:

```jsx
// In your Next.js page or component JSX:
<div className="relative w-full h-screen overflow-hidden bg-black"> 
  {/* Full-screen container for the elevator scene */}
  <Canvas className="absolute top-0 left-0 w-full h-full"
          camera={{ fov: 60, near: 0.1, far: 1000, position: [0, 1.6, 5] }}>
    {/* ...Your 3D scene contents... */}
  </Canvas>
</div>
```

- **`w-full h-screen`**: Makes the container full width and full viewport height (100vh).  
- **`relative`**: Allows absolutely positioning the canvas inside.  
- **`overflow-hidden`**: Crops any content that might render outside the container’s bounds (this lets the canvas act like a cover image, hiding off-screen parts on narrow screens).  
- **`bg-black`** (optional): Sets a black background behind the canvas for a cinematic feel (in case aspect ratio differences reveal any background).  
- **Canvas `className="absolute top-0 left-0 w-full h-full"`**: Makes the Three.js canvas fill the container exactly. The canvas will automatically resize with the container (since R3F’s Canvas is responsive by default in how it handles the viewport). 

**Tailwind Tip:** If this canvas container lives inside a flex layout (e.g. alongside other content), be sure to override the default flex item min-width. In Tailwind you can add `min-w-0` to the parent flex item to prevent the canvas from forcing an overly wide container ([reactjs - React Three Fiber Canvas Stretches its Parent and Becomes Unresponsive - Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/76940083/react-three-fiber-canvas-stretches-its-parent-and-becomes-unresponsive#:~:text=By%20default%2C%20,Canvas)). This avoids layout breakage where the canvas might stretch its parent:

```jsx
<div className="flex">
  <div className="min-w-0 flex-grow">
    <!-- Canvas container here -->
  </div>
  <div className="w-1/3">...other content...</div>
</div>
```

Here, `min-w-0` ensures the canvas container can shrink below its content size if needed ([reactjs - React Three Fiber Canvas Stretches its Parent and Becomes Unresponsive - Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/76940083/react-three-fiber-canvas-stretches-its-parent-and-becomes-unresponsive#:~:text=By%20default%2C%20,Canvas)).

## 3. Camera Setup and Dynamic Framing 
To keep the **elevator centered and fully in view**, configure the camera with an appropriate Field of View (FOV) and aspect ratio handling:
- **Initial Camera Config:** In the `<Canvas>` above, we set `camera={{ fov: 60, position: [0, 1.6, 5] }}` as a starting point (60° FOV, positioned at eye-level ~1.6m high, 5 units back). A moderately narrow FOV (e.g. 50–75°) gives a cinematic look without extreme distortion ([Three JS Perspective Camera FOV and Near/Far - Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/75942799/three-js-perspective-camera-fov-and-near-far#:~:text=Overflow%20stackoverflow,move%20the%20camera%20back)). The example uses 60°, but adjust based on how much of the elevator you want to see. The smaller the FOV, the more “zoomed in” the view (requiring the camera to be farther to frame the elevator) ([Three JS Perspective Camera FOV and Near/Far - Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/75942799/three-js-perspective-camera-fov-and-near-far#:~:text=Overflow%20stackoverflow,move%20the%20camera%20back)). A larger FOV captures more of the scene (wider angle) but can distort perspective.
- **Aspect Ratio:** R3F will auto-update the camera’s aspect on resize if you use the Canvas `camera` prop or a `<PerspectiveCamera makeDefault />` inside. This means as the viewport changes shape, the camera’s projection adjusts so the scene doesn’t appear stretched. However, simply maintaining aspect isn’t enough — we also need to **adapt the framing** (either via FOV or camera distance) so the elevator doesn’t get cut off on very narrow screens.

### Dynamic Camera Adjustment on Resize 
We can hook into R3F’s size or use a media query to tweak the camera for small viewports:
1. **Detect viewport size in the scene:** Use the `useThree()` hook to access the renderer size and camera. 
2. **Adjust FOV or position based on aspect ratio:** For portrait orientations (aspect ratio < 1), we can either **increase the FOV** or **pull the camera back** slightly to ensure the elevator width stays in frame. We prefer adjusting the camera distance to preserve the perspective look (avoiding an ultra-wide FOV that could distort the scene). 

**Example:** Increase camera distance on very narrow screens:
```jsx
// Inside your R3F <Canvas> scene component:
const { size, camera } = useThree();
useLayoutEffect(() => {
  if (!camera.isPerspectiveCamera) return;
  const aspect = size.width / size.height;
  camera.aspect = aspect;
  if (aspect < 0.6) {
    // Extremely narrow (e.g. ~Mobile portrait)
    camera.position.z = 6.5;  // pull camera further back
  } else if (aspect < 1) {
    // Slightly narrow (tablet or small laptop)
    camera.position.z = 5.5; 
  } else {
    // Wide screens (desktop landscape)
    camera.position.z = 5;   // default distance
  }
  camera.updateProjectionMatrix();
}, [size, camera]);
```

In this snippet, we check the **aspect ratio** each time the canvas resizes:
- For aspect < 0.6 (very tall and narrow, like an iPhone in portrait), we move the camera further out (from the default 5 to 6.5 units). This effectively “zooms out” the view, fitting more of the elevator’s sides into the narrow frame.  
- For aspect between 0.6 and 1, we apply a smaller adjustment (5.5).  
- For aspect ≥ 1 (landscape or square-ish screens), we use the original distance (5).  

These values are example tweaks – you should tune them based on your scene scale so that at the smallest expected screen, the **elevator doors and call button are just fully visible** (with maybe a small margin). On larger screens, this will result in extra space around the elevator (which is fine, as it reveals more of the environment). This approach ensures **critical elements never get cropped**, while allowing non-critical surroundings to fall outside the view on narrow displays.

Another approach is to adjust the camera’s FOV dynamically. For example, you could slightly increase `camera.fov` on narrow screens instead of moving the camera. Both methods have similar effect (wider view on mobile), but changing position is often simpler to manage. In practice, even a simple binary adjustment (e.g. “if mobile, set a farther camera position”) works well ([How to make my scene responsive for other devices? : r/threejs](https://www.reddit.com/r/threejs/comments/tt71nd/how_to_make_my_scene_responsive_for_other_devices/#:~:text=Thanks%2C%20I%27ll%20take%20a%20closer,works%20for%20now%20haha)):

> “On smartphones everything started to look excessively zoomed in. I ended up … put[ting] the camera a bit farther when I had to handle the 'small' screen case, otherwise just render everything how it is… it works for now.” ([How to make my scene responsive for other devices? : r/threejs](https://www.reddit.com/r/threejs/comments/tt71nd/how_to_make_my_scene_responsive_for_other_devices/#:~:text=Thanks%2C%20I%27ll%20take%20a%20closer,works%20for%20now%20haha))

**Note:** The `useLayoutEffect` above runs on each resize, updating the camera. This keeps the solution **scene-specific** (encapsulated within this component). You’re not adding any global window listeners manually – R3F’s internal resize observer triggers the update via the `size` dependency.

#### Alternate Auto-Framing (Optional) 
For a more automated solution, consider using [`<Bounds>` from @react-three/drei](https://github.com/pmndrs/drei#bounds) to fit the camera to your elevator model. Wrapping your elevator and button in `<Bounds fit clip observe>` will **zoom the camera to include those objects** and react to viewport changes ([How to make my scene responsive for other devices? : r/threejs](https://www.reddit.com/r/threejs/comments/tt71nd/how_to_make_my_scene_responsive_for_other_devices/#:~:text=another%20strategy%20could%20be%20zoom,clipping%2C%20and%20observe%20window%20resize)):
```jsx
<Bounds fit clip observe margin={1}>
  <ElevatorDoors /> 
  <ElevatorCallButton />
</Bounds>
``` 
This ensures the camera always frames the elevator and button. The `clip` option can be used to allow or prevent clipping at the view edges, and `observe` makes it responsive to resizes ([How to make my scene responsive for other devices? : r/threejs](https://www.reddit.com/r/threejs/comments/tt71nd/how_to_make_my_scene_responsive_for_other_devices/#:~:text=another%20strategy%20could%20be%20zoom,clipping%2C%20and%20observe%20window%20resize)). However, using Bounds is a bit heavier if you only have one known scene – our manual adjustment above is more lightweight and tailored. Use whichever fits your needs.

## 4. Preserving Critical Elements & Cropping the Rest 
The **focal point (elevator)** should always be centered and fully visible, while less important scene elements (e.g. hallway walls, ceiling) can be sacrificed on small screens. Here’s how to achieve this:

- **Center the Elevator in the Scene:** Position your elevator model at the origin or a known point the camera is targeting. For instance, if using a fixed camera, you might do `camera.lookAt(0, 1, 0)` assuming the elevator’s center is around y=1. This ensures the elevator stays in the middle of the view. Keep the call button very close to the doors, so they move together in the frame.  
- **Allow Cropping via Overflow:** As set in the CSS, the canvas overflow is hidden, so if the camera sees more scene than the screen can show (due to aspect difference), those parts just won’t be visible. This is analogous to a background image with `object-fit: cover`: the center is maintained and edges are cut off on different aspect screens. **We purposely do not letterbox or pillarbox** – the canvas always fills the screen. The camera logic from Section 3 guarantees that at least the elevator and button fit within the smallest dimension. For example, if the screen is very narrow, the camera was pulled back to fit the elevator’s width; if the screen is very wide, the elevator still fits easily and you simply see extra space on sides. 
- **Verify on Extreme Cases:** Test on an iPhone SE or similar small device to ensure the **call button is not off-screen.** If it is, adjust the camera distance or FOV until it’s just inside the frame. It’s acceptable (and expected) that on such a small device you might not see, say, the full width of the elevator *shaft* or surrounding floor – as long as the **doors and button** are visible, the experience is intact.

If needed, you can further fine-tune by slightly translating the camera on very narrow screens (for example, panning a tiny bit to the side where the button is). Typically this won’t be necessary if the button is near the door, but it’s an option. We avoid altering the composition on larger screens at all – those get the pure centered elevator view.

## 5. CSS & Tailwind Techniques for Responsiveness 
While most of the heavy lifting is done by the camera, a few CSS considerations ensure the canvas behaves nicely:

- **100% in Layout:** Make sure parent elements of the canvas container do not impose fixed sizes that break responsiveness. In Next.js, you might want to set your page `<div className="min-h-screen">` or similar. If using a custom `<Layout>`, ensure the canvas section can grow/shrink freely (again, `min-w-0` on flex containers is important ([reactjs - React Three Fiber Canvas Stretches its Parent and Becomes Unresponsive - Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/76940083/react-three-fiber-canvas-stretches-its-parent-and-becomes-unresponsive#:~:text=By%20default%2C%20,Canvas))).
- **Global CSS (if needed):** Sometimes setting `html, body { height:100%; width:100%; margin:0; }` in a global CSS or Tailwind base styles is useful to ensure `h-screen` and full-width elements actually occupy the full viewport with no scroll. If you encounter a vertical scrollbar on mobile due to 100vh not accounting for address bar, consider using the CSS `height: 100dvh` unit (dynamic viewport height) or the safe area inset variables. For example, you could add a utility or style for `min-h-[100dvh]` to use in place of `h-screen` on the container for a more consistent mobile behavior. This ensures the canvas truly spans the available screen height on iOS Safari.
- **Tailwind Breakpoints:** If you need to adjust any styling at specific screen sizes, leverage Tailwind’s responsive modifiers. For example, you might reduce padding or change text overlay size on small screens with classes like `md:text-2xl text-xl`. In our case, the 3D canvas is mostly handled via camera logic, so additional Tailwind breakpoints might not be necessary. But you could use them if you had HTML overlays or wanted to hide certain non-critical 3D details on smaller screens (by conditionally rendering in React based on `size.width` or a CSS media query).

## 6. Mobile Usability Best Practices 
Lastly, ensure the experience is **interactive and user-friendly on mobile**:

- **Touch Interaction:** @react-three/fiber uses Pointer Events under the hood, so events like `onClick` on meshes will work with touch by default ([React-three-fiber, raycaster, touch events, mobile - Questions - three.js forum](https://discourse.threejs.org/t/react-three-fiber-raycaster-touch-events-mobile/21430#:~:text=mjurczyk%20%20December%209%2C%202020%2C,5%3A41pm%20%202)). Make sure your elevator button mesh has an event handler (e.g. `<mesh onClick={handleElevatorCall}>`). If you find taps not registering, use `onPointerDown` instead of `onClick` as a fallback (sometimes fast taps or certain controls can interfere) ([React-three-fiber, raycaster, touch events, mobile - Questions - three.js forum](https://discourse.threejs.org/t/react-three-fiber-raycaster-touch-events-mobile/21430#:~:text=mjurczyk%20%20December%209%2C%202020%2C,5%3A41pm%20%202)). Also, disable any hover-only effects for mobile or provide a visible focus state since users can’t hover with touch.
- **Clickable Area:** Tiny objects can be hard to tap. If the on-screen size of the call button is very small, consider enlarging its interactive area. You can do this by attaching an invisible larger hit zone (e.g., a transparent plane or sphere that’s slightly bigger, parented to the button). This way, the user doesn’t have to tap the *exact pixel* of a small 3D button. Keep the actual visual size the same, but make the collision area larger for easier tapping.
- **No Accidental Scrolling:** If the canvas is full-screen and meant to be an immersive intro, you probably want to prevent the page from scrolling while interacting. The `overflow-hidden` on the container helps by not extending beyond one screen, but also ensure no other content is causing scroll. You can conditionally add `touch-action: none; overscroll-behavior: none;` via CSS on the canvas container to disable gestures like pull-to-refresh or scrolling when over the canvas if that becomes an issue.
- **Performance on Mobile:** For smooth interaction, consider optimizing for mobile devices:
  - Limit the pixel ratio: `<Canvas dpr={[1, 2]}>` will cap device pixel ratio to 2 (so e.g. on a very high DPI phone, it won’t render at 3x pixel density which can hurt performance). This retains visual sharpness on Retina screens without overworking the GPU.
  - Simplify materials or effects for mobile if needed (e.g. fewer shadows, simpler shader on low-end devices). This can be done by feature-detecting or using `size.width`/`size.height` to infer if it’s a smaller device and toggling detail accordingly.
- **Guidance and Fallbacks:** Given this is an intro, make it obvious to the user what to do. For example, you might show a brief text or an arrow indicator near the button saying “Tap the button” on mobile. This can be an HTML overlay `<div>` positioned with Tailwind (e.g. absolutely positioned near the corresponding spot) or a simple sprite in the 3D scene. Ensure any such UI is also responsive (using CSS percent or viewport units for positioning). For **very constrained devices** (like older phones), if the 3D scene is extremely hard to use or performance is poor, you could offer a fallback: e.g., a static image or a simplified 2D representation of the elevator. This is rarely needed with proper optimization, but it’s good practice to at least handle the case where WebGL might fail (you can detect WebGL support and show an alternate banner or message).

By following these practices, the elevator intro will maintain its cinematic impact across devices. On a widescreen desktop, users will see the full expanse of the elevator and surroundings. On a tiny portrait phone, they’ll see a focused view of the elevator doors and button (with everything important reachable), and the scene will **still feel natural** – just like a well-cropped movie scene that fills the screen. The combination of TailwindCSS for fluid sizing and smart camera adjustments ensures an optimal, **immersive 3D experience that is mobile-friendly and responsive**. Enjoy your responsive Severance-style elevator ride!
