# Welcome to My Blog

This is a sample blog post that demonstrates various markdown features and syntax highlighting.

## Code Examples

Here's a TypeScript React component:

```tsx showLineNumbers
interface Props {
  name: string;
}

export function Greeting({ name }: Props) {
  return (
    <div className="bg-primary p-4 text-black dark:text-white">
      <h1>Hello, {name}!</h1>
    </div>
  );
}
```
