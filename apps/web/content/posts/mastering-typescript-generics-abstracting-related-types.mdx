# Mastering TypeScript Generics: Abstracting Related Types

TypeScript generics are a powerful feature that allows you to write flexible, reusable code that works with a variety of types. In this post, we'll explore how generics can help you abstract related types, leading to more maintainable and scalable code.

## What are Generics?

Generics in TypeScript allow you to create components that can work over a variety of types rather than a single one. They act as a kind of placeholder for a type that will be specified later.

Let's start with a simple example:

```ts
function identity<T>(arg: T): T {
  return arg;
}

let output = identity<string>("myString");
console.log(output); // Output: myString
```
