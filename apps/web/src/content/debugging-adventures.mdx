# Adventures in Debugging: A Developer's Tale

Every developer has been there - staring at their code, wondering why something that should work... just doesn't. Let's talk about debugging strategies and how to maintain sanity during troubleshooting sessions.

## The Debugging Mindset

When faced with a bug, it's essential to approach the problem systematically. Here's my tried-and-true process:

1. **Reproduce the Issue**

   - Identify the exact steps that cause the bug
   - Document the expected vs. actual behavior

2. **Isolate the Problem**

   - Remove unnecessary variables
   - Create a minimal reproduction case

3. **Gather Information**
   - Check the console logs
   - Review recent changes
   - Look for similar issues in documentation

## Common Debugging Tools

```ts
// Using console.log strategically
function debugThis(data: unknown) {
  console.log("=== Debug Start ===");
  console.log("Type:", typeof data);
  console.log("Value:", data);
  console.log("=== Debug End ===");
  return data;
}

// Using debugger statement
function troubleshootThis() {
  let problem = "mysterious";
  debugger; // Browser will pause here when dev tools are open
  return `Fixed ${problem} issue`;
}
```
